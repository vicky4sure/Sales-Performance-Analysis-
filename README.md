1. Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://microsoft.com)
-  for data cleaning and preparation.
- utilized excel formulars to calculate keys metrics such as Average (AVG) and total sales, total revenue by region.
-   Created data visualizations using pivot table and charts to identify trends and insights.

### Data cleaning and preparation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation,we perform the following action;
1.  Microsoft Excel:
- data loading and inspection of the entire dataset
- Highlight the entire table to remove duplicates
- Cleaned data is ready to perform key metrics, prepare pivot tables and charts like pie chart, bars, column charts that will aids decision making.
  
2.  SQL; Stuctured Query Language:
     - imported data from excel by creating a new database in SQL Server under LITA_DB
     - Used SQL Commands to remove excess columns and rows directly
     - Write queries on the data set provided to determine the toatl revenue per product and to determine the percentage of total sales contributed by
       each region that will the retail store in their business decison making.
       
3.  POWERBI ;Power Business Intelligence:
    - Loaded a cleaned data via Get data option on Home Menu and entered Power Query Editor; to transform the data
    - Examined the data column quality, column profile and column distibution to check for error, empty, uniqueness and distinct of the data
    - Visual the data by creating dashboard to make use of tables, cards, matrix, slicers/filter and column, bar and pie chart etc. to determine the total revenue by region,
      sum of quantity sold by product, sum of revenue by product to help in providing insight how the retail store has made progress over the years, through report view
      To beautify the dashboard/report through the use of format tool (pencil icon) to make use of different size and style, padding, call out value, title, font size, colour, slicer etc. 
      
   ### Exploratory data analysis
   EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
   - what is the overall sales trend
   - which product are top sellers
   - To determine the regional breakdown for the total revenue, quantity sold, average revenue and product
    ```
     ### Data analysis
     ---
     This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of DAX expressions used during your analysis;

     ```SQL
     SELECT*FROM TABLE 1
     WHERE CONDITION =TRUE
     ```
